### What is expected?

Calculate a composites of your data based on a climate index other than Nino3.4 and plot maps of your composite.

If you already have a climate index you wish to use, you may use it. 

If you need a climate index, a set of climate indices have been placed in the directory

`/shared/ccsm4/kpegion/obs2/CLIM_INDICES/`

These were obtained from [NOAA/ESRL/PSL](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/climateindices/list/) and the link gives you more information about the indices.

A sample notebook for how to read this data and turn into an `xarray.Dataset` is located [here](https://github.com/kpegion/clim680-codes/blob/gh-pages/src/clim_index.ipynb)

### When is it due?
Nov 12

### How do I turn it in?
